*Klangstrom* is a subtractive infrastructure design framework. KLST_PANDA is designed to feature an educated set of features and peripherals acompanied by a *pragmatic* firmware. the design goal is to allow quick protoyping and development on the board and then in a secons step adapt hard- and software to individual needs.

One example of a *subtracted* design is the KLST_CATERPILLAR board which features the same MCU but lacks many of the peripherals:
