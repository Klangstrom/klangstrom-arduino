*Klangstrom* supplies an application structure to facilitate the development of applications. 

*Klangstrom* extends the arduino *idiom* ( i.e `setup`) + `loop()`Â ) with sound, music + event related functions ( e.g `audioblock()` + `beat()` ). *Klangstrom* also implements a simple abstraction layer to unify access to peripherals ( e.g `data_receive()` + `data_transmit()` ).
