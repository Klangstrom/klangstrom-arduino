*Klangstrom* (KLST) is an infrastructure to facilitate generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition. *klangstrom* is comprised of two software libraries ( *klang* a node+text-based sound synthesis library and *strom* a node+text-based generative composition library ), an embedded hardware platform, and a programming environment to allow seamless development of generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition applications.

*Klangstrom for Arduino* is a distribution of the *Klangstrom* library in the *Arduino IDE* for *Klangstrom* boards ( e.g KLST_TINY ) as well as a simulator environment to run *Klangstrom* on a desktop machine from within the *Arduino IDE*. 

note, that this repository is only used for arduino hardware library ( *board* in arduino terms ) releases. the development of the klangstrom project happens ( incl other platform and hardware ) in a dedicated repository at [klangstrom](https://github.com/interaktion-und-raum/klangstrom/) ( currently a private repository ). however, the development process can be followed in the [developer diary](https://klangstrom.dennisppaul.de).

find instructions on how to install the library in the documentations. please use the [issues tracking system](https://github.com/dennisppaul/klangstrom-arduino/issues) to submit bugs + feature requests.

see [Documentation](https://dennisppaul.github.io/klangstrom-arduino/) for detailed information.
