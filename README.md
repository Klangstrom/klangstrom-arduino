*Klangstrom* (KLST) is an infrastructure to facilitate generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition. *klangstrom* is comprised of two software libraries ( *klang* a node+text-based sound synthesis library and *strom* a node+text-based generative composition library ), an embedded hardware platform, and a programming environment to allow seamless development of generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition applications.

*Klangstrom for Arduino* is a distribution of the *Klangstrom* library in the *Arduino IDE* for *Klangstrom* boards ( e.g KLST_SHEEP or KLST_TINY ) as well as a simulator environment to run *Klangstrom* on a desktop machine from within the *Arduino IDE*. 

note, that this repository is only used to distribute releases of the *arduino hardware library* ( or *board* in arduino-terms ). the development of the Klangstrom project itself happens in a dedicated repository at [Klangstrom](https://github.com/interaktion-und-raum/klangstrom/) ( currently a private repository ). however, the development process can be followed in the [Klangstrom Developer Diary](https://klangstrom.dennisppaul.de).

find instructions on how to install the library in the [documentations](https://klangstrom-for-arduino.dennisppaul.de/installation/). please use the [issues tracking system](https://github.com/dennisppaul/klangstrom-arduino/issues) to submit bugs + feature requests and but also consult the [FAQ](https://klangstrom-for-arduino.dennisppaul.de/faq/) if experiencing issues. see [Klangstrom for Arduino Documentation](https://klangstrom-for-arduino.dennisppaul.de) for detailed information on how to get started.

the klangstrom hardware designs are located in a dedicated repository and can be found at [Klangstrom Hardware](https://github.com/dennisppaul/klangstrom-hardware).
